title: 100DaysOfCode Day 1 and 2 - just started!
---
Yesterday 18-06-2016 I have started my **100DaysOfCode**.

To learn more about Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages, I decided to create my first blog. Yesterday I did it just using GitHub Pages, but today I have found an interesting article at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and recreated it using also [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

It took a lot of time, but it is a good start point to become better familiar with all this "Git" stuff.
This blog will change many times I suppose. 
The next step will be local Jekyll installation and making posts on my local repository.

Why did I started this challenge?
I have read [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.lw0vs8mz7) written by Alexander Kallaway and decided to join. I learn code with help of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) since April 2016 and I need a "way" to go faster with this. I hope the **100DaysOfCode** will give me a kick :smiley: 

I want to make post everyday and describe what I have done.
So keep going!
