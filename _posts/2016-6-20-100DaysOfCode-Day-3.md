Today I am working at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) challenge ["Build a Tribute Page"](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

I am building a website about polish World War II hero [Rotamaster Witold Pilecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki).

It is created in [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) using Bootstrap 3. I'll show the link when I'll finish it. Propably tomorrow.

Now I am going back to work!
